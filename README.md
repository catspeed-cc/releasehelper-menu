# releasehelper-menu 

## Warning:
This repository has loose rules, no branch protections, no development branch, and commits are direct and frequent (or spammy) to master - because it is wholly my project and not intended to be included for release, only for mainly myself, but also developers of forks of my repositories to improve development/release workflow :)

There will be no `current version` - the `current version` is whatever you `git clone` and `git pull`. If I am developing this menu at the time, pull frequently lmao I might break it.

Example: you fork all the repositories (releasehelper-menu, docker-full-dir, subtree-docker-compose-lib AND sd-webui-forge-docker AND/OR sd-webui-reforge-docker) and modify them to your fork. You leave a terminal/tab open with the menu script running - it is looped :) So you can do operations, return to menu, do more operations, return ... until infinity!

## Status:
Broken and I am done for the night. Turns out the items in the first paragraph of "warning" are ... bad choices for reasons (entire rh-menu script is down for my own use :P)

## Support:

There is "no other help" - no support. No issue tickets. I will try and make the scripts as interactive as possible, adding the remotes should ask for a git remote url for example for each project.

If you have cloned the releasehelper-menu or forked any repository and made changes, at this point, _you have become the developer,_ thus I cannot help you.

## Installation & Usage:

An interactive custom release helper script for [sd-webui-forge-docker](https://github.com/catspeed-cc/sd-webui-forge-docker) and [sd-webui-reforge-docker](https://github.com/catspeed-cc/sd-webui-reforge-docker) (will only work with these without modifications)

- run `git clone https://github.com/catspeed-cc/releasehelper-menu.git /path/to/where/you/want/rh-menu`
- run `echo "export PATH=\${PATH}:/path/to/where/you/put/rh-menu" | tee -a ~/.bashrc`
- run `rh-menu` from inide [sd-webui-forge-docker](https://github.com/catspeed-cc/sd-webui-forge-docker) or [sd-webui-reforge-docker](https://github.com/catspeed-cc/sd-webui-reforge-docker) repository

It is now in your PATH / .bashrc

- to update `cd /path/to/where/you/put/rh-menu && git pull origin/master`.
- to use `cd path/to/where/your/sd-forge-or-sd-reforge-docker-installation` and `rh-menu` from inside any subdirectory of the installation

Appears to work more properly - I'm welcome. Your welcome.

**_Thoughts:_** I could make a "dummy" fork >:) to make the releasehelper-menu work inside the releasehelper-menu repository too that would be _sweet_ üçª

P.S. This small dev release helper menu helped me find a few bugs in the menu's command execution for my dockerized projects.

P.P.S. The fixes will be in the v1.1.3 compatibility version I am working on to make both dockerized projects compatible. I have a plan for this compatibility. I have already implemented fork detection which helped releasehelper-menu too :)
